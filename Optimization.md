The hardware of X50 IHU is slow due to limitation of E01 based SoC and limited memory.

However, there are a few unused apps can be disabled to make things less suffering. 

Disabled app will no longer show in App Menu.

In case of issue, you may also restore the app.

### Disable Proton Calendar

This is the least useful app to me. 

Use following script to disable it.

### Disable Proton Maps

This is by far improve the most performance.

Take note that once disabled, Maps display in ATLAS home will no longer show maps.

### Disable QDLink

This has been included if you run the app installation script.

Included here for sake of completion.

### Disable OTA

To avoid accidentally tap on Settings -> System Update or Update pushed by Acotech.

This does not stops SC or Support Person from updating IHU manually through a special USB.

### Disable Weather 

You will no longer able to see weather in ATLAS home.

Since the weather forecast from my phone much more correct than this, I choose to disable it too.
